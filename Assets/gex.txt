		"-w.|Huh?",
		"-w.|Why was that wrong?",
		"-w.|Uh, Mr Edgework? Can you take a look at this?",
		"+b_04|(This is the fourth time Blimp's asked me today, what now?)|w|p|What's the problem?",
		"-w.|Ok, so I was learning Forget Me Not and I pressed the first 4 digits correctly.",
		"-w.|Then, I got the 5th stage wrong.",
		"+w.|No point just telling me that it was wrong, what did you do for that stage?",
		"-w.|...I was literally about to tell you.",
		"-w.|I submitted 4858 so far, and the displayed digit was a 5 for that stage.",
		"-w.|There are no zeros in the previous two and there aren't two even numbers, so I add the previous two digits together.",
		"-w.|After that you take the least significant digit and add the displayed digit, which should give me 8, but it wanted 6.",
		"+w_121619|Hmmm, yeah I see what happened.|rww|ppp|The module is bugged.|You need to subtract the displayed digit.|You need to take the most significant digit.",
		"-w,|Wh- It's bugged?",
		"-w,|You're telling me this mod that's been out for 4 years is bugged?",
		"-w,|4 YEARS?",
		"+bX11|(Oh hold on let me think about this again, there's no way that it's bugged after all this time.)",
		"+w,|Yeah, I see, you are supposed to subtract the displayed digit instead of add.",
		"-w,|Ok, so that means I need to do 8 + 5 - 5, which gives me, What? That still doesn't give me the right answer?",
		"+bX11|(Coming to think of that, I'm pretty sure I remembered the rules wrong, I may need to get more sleep.)",
		"+w.|Yeah, I see, you need to take the most significant digit instead of the least.",
		"-w.|Wait, what? What does that mean?",
		"+w.|Most significant just means the first digit, so the sum of 8 + 5 is 13, and the most significant digit is 1.",
		"-w.|So I add this 1 to the 5, which gives me- Ohhhhh!",
		"+b!|(This rule used to always trip me up, but I'm glad I remembered it properly this time.)"
