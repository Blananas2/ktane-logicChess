"-w_1209|I was trying to learn new mods and got an Assorted Arrangement strike.|br|pb|Let's see if I could help.|Do you have a logfile?",
"-w.|What's a logfile?",
"+b.|(With the paper manuals and the lack of knowledge of a logfile. He appears to be a little too old school.)",
"+b.|(I think I don't have a choice but to manually help him.)",

"+w.|You needed to press each button one less than what you pressed.",
"-w!|It all makes sense now! I should probably update my manuals sometime today. Thanks for the help!"
